 Hi, I am Adogbeji Agberien. I reside in Ottawa, Canada's capital city, where I am currently a Biology and Data Science MSc. candidate. I attained my BSc. in Environmental Science, with minors in Biology and Statistics. Prior to pursuing grad studies, I worked as a Data Analyst at Ecofich research and as an undergraduate student, I worked as a Calculus Teaching Assistant, and Undergraduate Research Assistant. My interests are software development for analytics, statistics, statistical machine learning, and biology.
