I am a firm believer in the Ronald Coase quote "Torture  the data, and it will confess to anything". My take, you just have to be asking the right questions. Broadly speaking, some of the topics I enjoy include Ecology, Bioinformatics, and Machine Learning. I am currently a Biology and Data Science graduate student at Carleton University.
