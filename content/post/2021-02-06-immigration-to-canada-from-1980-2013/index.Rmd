Just the other day, I was scrolling through Kaggle searching for datasets to play with. There it was, right in front on me, the Canadian immigration data from 1980 to 2013. Considering that I am a data point in there, I did not need extra motivation to peep this one. That said, immigration is obviously more complex than my sole data point; the aggregation of data tells a story. People migrate for economic, environmental, political, or social reasons. [Push or pull factors](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8x6wxs/revision/2) trigger the decision to migrate. Studying migration trends and networks of movement from across the globe can inform on the state of the immigrants' origin. Hope you enjoy the viz! ðŸ‘‡
