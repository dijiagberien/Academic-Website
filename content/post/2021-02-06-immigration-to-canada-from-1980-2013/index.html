<p>Just the other day, I was scrolling through Kaggle searching for datasets to work on. There it was, right in front of me, the Canadian immigration data from 1980 to 2013. Considering that I am a data point in there, I did not need extra motivation to peep this one. That said, immigration is obviously more complex than my sole data point; the aggregation of data tells a story. People migrate for economic, environmental, political, or social reasons. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8x6wxs/revision/2">Push or pull factors</a> trigger the decision to migrate. Studying migration trends and networks of movement from across the globe can inform on the state of the immigrantsâ€™ origin. Hope you enjoy the viz! ðŸ‘‡</p>
