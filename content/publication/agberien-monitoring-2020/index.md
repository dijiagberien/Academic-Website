abstract: Management of cyanobacteria blooms and their negative impact on human and
  ecosystem health requires effective tools for monitoring their concentration in
  water bodies. This research investigated the potential of derivative spectrophotometry
  in detection and monitoring of cyanobacteria using toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains
  of Microcystis aeruginosa. Microcystis aeruginosa was quantified in deionized water
  and surface water using traditional spectrophotometry and the first derivative of
  absorbance. The first derivative of absorbance was effective in improving the signal
  of traditional spectrophotometry; however, it was not adequate in differentiating
  between signal and noise at low concentrations. Savitzky-Golay coefficients for
  first derivative were used to smooth the derivative spectra and improve the correlation
  between concentration and noise at low concentrations. Derivative spectrophotometry
  improved the detection limit as much as eight times in deionized water and as much
  as four times in surface water. The lowest detection limit measured in surface water
  with traditional spectrophotometry was 392,982 cells/mL, and the Savitzky-Golay
  first derivative of absorbance was 90,231 cells/mL. The method provided herein provides
  a promising tool in real-time monitoring of cyanobacteria concentrations and spectrophotometry
  offers the ability to measure water quality parameters together with cyanobacteria
  concentrations.
